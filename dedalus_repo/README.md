## About Dedalus

Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using spectral methods.
The code is open-source and developed by a team of researchers working on problems in astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics.

The code is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface, including text-based equation entry.
Our numerical algorithm produces highly sparse systems for a wide variety of equations on spectrally-discretized domains.
These systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and multidimensional parallelization though MPI.
