Getting started with Dedalus
****************************

Tutorial Notebooks
==================

This tutorial on using Dedalus consists of three short IPython notebooks, which can be downloaded and ran interactively, or viewed on-line through the links below.

The notebooks cover the basics of setting up and interacting with the primary facets of the code, culminating in the setup and simulation of the 1D KdV-Burgers equation.

   Tutorial 1: Bases and Domains <notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_bases_domains.ipynb>
   Tutorial 2: Fields and Operators <notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_fields_operators.ipynb>
   Tutorial 3: Problems and Solvers <notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_problems_solvers.ipynb>
   Tutorial 4: Analysis and Post-processing <notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_analysis_postprocessing.ipynb>

Example Notebooks
=================

Below are several notebooks that walk through the setup and execution of more complicated multidimensional example problems.

   Example 1: Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability <notebooks/KelvinHelmholtzInstability.ipynb>
   Example 2: Taylor-Couette Flow <notebooks/TaylorCouetteFlow.ipynb>

Example Scripts
===============

A wider range of examples are available under the ``examples`` subdirectory of the main code repository, which you can browse `here <https://bitbucket.org/dedalus-project/dedalus/src/tip/examples/?at=default>`_.
These examples cover a wider range of use cases, including larger multidimensional problems designed for parallel execution.
Basic post-processing and plotting scripts are also provided with many problems.

These simulation and processing scripts may be useful as a starting point for implementing different problems and equation sets.

Contributions & Suggestions
===========================

If you have a script that you'd like to make available as an example, or to request an additional example covering different functionality or use cases, please get in touch on the `dev list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dedalus-dev>`_!
