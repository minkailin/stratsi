"""
Dedalus script for the Lane-Emden equation.

This is a 1D script and should be ran serially.  It should converge within
roughly a dozen iterations, and should take under a minute to run.

In astrophysics, the Lane–Emden equation is a dimensionless form of Poisson's
equation for the gravitational potential of a Newtonian self-gravitating,
spherically symmetric, polytropic fluid [1].

It is usually written as:
    dr(dr(f)) + (2/r)*dr(f) + f**n = 0
    f(r=0) = 1
where n is the polytropic index, and the equation is solved over the interval
r=[0,R], where R is the n-dependent first zero of f(r). Although the equation
is second order, it is singular at r=0, and therefore only requires a single
outer boundary condition.

Following [2], we rescale the equation by defining r=R*x:
    dx(dx(f)) + (2/x)*dx(f) + (R**2)*(f**n) = 0
    f(x=0) = 1
    f(x=1) = 0
This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem over the interval x=[0,1], with the
additional boundary condition fixing the eigenvalue R.
